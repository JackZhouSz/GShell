## Introduction

This is the official implementation of "Ghost on the Shell: An Expressive Representation of General 3D Shapes" (G-Shell).

G-Shell is a generic and differentiable representation for both watertight and non-watertight meshes. It enables 1) efficient and robust rasterization-based multiview reconstruction and 2) template-free generation of non-watertight meshes.

Please refer to [our project page](https://gshell3d.github.io) and [our paper](https://gshell3d.github.io/static/paper/gshell.pdf) for more details.


## Code coming soon!
